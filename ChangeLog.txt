FileBrowser Adobe Air Native Extension

*Feb 04, 2016 - V4.0.1*
* Fixed resizing/scaling of images in Android and iOS


*Jan 21, 2016 - V4.0.0*
* Now you can optionally resize an image with native speed as soon as you pick an image. simply pass in an object like this _ex.choose("image/*", "pick an image!", {width:500, height:500, quality:50});
* bypassing xCode 7.2 bug causing iOS conflict when compiling with AirSDK 20 without waiting on Adobe or Apple to fix the problem. This is a must have upgrade for your app to make sure you can compile multiple ANEs in your project with AirSDK 20 or greater. https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2055508 https://forums.adobe.com/message/8294948
