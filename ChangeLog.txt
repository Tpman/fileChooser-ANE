FileBrowser Adobe Air Native Extension


May 06, 2013	>> V1.0: 	beginning of the journey!
Oct 15, 2015	>> V3.0:	Added iOS support (for picking images only at the moment)
Nov 03, 2015	>> V3.9:	doitflash devs merged into MyFLashLab Team.
Dec 20, 2015 	>> V3.9.1: 	minor bug fixes

Jan 21, 2016	>> V4.0.0:	Now you can optionally resize an image with native speed as soon as you pick an image.
							simply pass in an object like this _ex.choose("image/*", "pick an image!", {width:500, height:500, quality:50});
							how you get the image path in FileChooserEvent.RESULT has also changed a bit as follow:
							private function onResult(e:FileChooserEvent):void
							{
								var originalFile:File = e.param.original;
								
								// e.param.resized is only available if you are picking an image and have specified the resize object for it.
								var resizedFile:File = e.param.resized;
							}
							
							bypassing xCode 7.2 bug causing iOS conflict when compiling with AirSDK 20 without waiting on Adobe or Apple to fix the problem.
							This is a must have upgrade for your app to make sure you can compile multiple ANEs in your project with AirSDK 20 or greater.
